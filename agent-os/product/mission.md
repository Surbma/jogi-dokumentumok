# Product Mission

## Product Name
**Jogi Dokumentumok** (Legal Documents Repository)

## Vision Statement
A centralized, version-controlled repository for PremiumWP legal documents that ensures consistency, traceability, and multi-format accessibility for all stakeholders.

## Problem Statement
Managing legal documents across different formats and versions is error-prone and time-consuming. Teams need a reliable way to:
- Track changes to legal documents over time
- Maintain consistency across multiple output formats
- Provide easy access for both internal teams and external clients
- Ensure document integrity and version history

## Solution
A Git-based document repository using Markdown as the source of truth, with structured version tracking and multi-format output capabilities (MD, HTML, PDF).

## Core Value Propositions
1. **Single Source of Truth** - Markdown files serve as the authoritative source for all legal documents
2. **Version Control** - Complete change history with semantic versioning and detailed changelog
3. **Multi-Format Output** - Documents available in Markdown, HTML (for web), and PDF (for download)
4. **Transparency** - Clear documentation of all changes and their rationale
