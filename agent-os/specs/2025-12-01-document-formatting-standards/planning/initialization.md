# Spec Initialization: Document Formatting Standards

## Original Description

The user wants to create uniform heading styling and text formatting standards across all legal documents in this repository. The reference document is `md/aszf-premiumwp-optimalizalas.md`.

The goal is to:
1. Analyze and document all syntax and formatting patterns used in the reference document
2. Create a comprehensive formatting standards guide
3. Add this guide to the README.md for future reference
4. Ensure all future modifications follow these standards

## Context

This is a documentation/standardization spec, not a software feature. The output will be formatting guidelines to maintain consistency across legal documents (ÁSzF, VKSz documents).
